# _Pierre's Bakery Vendor and Order Tracker_

#### By _**Rosario Ruvalcaba**_

#### _This program consists of an MVC application that helps track the vendors that purchase baked goods from 'Pierre's Bakery' and the orders for those vendors. Pierre can view a list of Vendors as well as their Orders and add to both._

## Technologies Used

* _C#_
* _ASP .Net Core_
* _Razor View Engine_
* _RESTful routing conventions_
* _MSTest (Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk)_
* _Markdown, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML_

## Description

_This project was created as an independent project for Epicodus following the section on Basic Web Applications with C#. The program welcomes 'Pierre' and allows him to view and add to a list of Vendors for his bakery and their orders._

_MSTest was used to unit test the Models. RESTful routing conventions were used to name the routes for the different views._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone repository from Github and save a copy on own computer._

* _If saving repository remotely, make an initial commit pushing ONLY your .gitignore file so bin/ and obj/ directories are not pushed._

* _Ensure you have C# and .NET installed by running the command [dotnet --version] in your terminal. If the response is not a version number, install .NET from Microsoft website._

* _Navigate to the BakeryTracker directory in the project and run the command [dotnet restore, then dotnet build]._

* _While still in the Bakery subdirectory, run the command [dotnet run] to run the application using a localhost server._

## Known Bugs

* _The ordered lists of orders on the Vendor Details page is not formatting correctly -- the numbers which number the list items are left-aligned while the actual list items are centered._
